This xdc file contains all pin assignments and timing constraints needed to successfully implement designs on this platform. The file includes:

1. **Complete DDR4 Memory Interface Constraints**
   - All 72 data pins for the PL side SODIMM (64 data + 8 ECC)
   - All 72 data pins for the PS side memory components
   - All control signals with proper I/O standards
   - DQS pairs with differential signaling standards

2. **Clock Definitions and Timing Constraints**
   - System clock (DDR4 reference)
   - PL user clock
   - QSFP28 reference clocks
   - ADC/DAC reference clocks (all 8 tiles)
   - FMC+ reference and GTY clocks
   - Processor system clocks
   - Asynchronous clock group definitions

3. **I/O Standard Specifications**
   - LVDS for differential signaling
   - LVCMOS18 for single-ended I/O
   - SSTL12_DCI and POD12_DCI for DDR4 memory interfaces
   - Termination settings for high-speed interfaces

4. **False Path and Max Delay Constraints**
   - False paths for buttons, switches, and LEDs
   - Maximum delay constraints for I2C and other control interfaces
   - Input/output delay constraints for user I/O

This XDC file serves as a complete reference for all pin assignments on the HTG-ZRF16 board and can be used directly with Xilinx Vivado for implementing designs. It covers all the interfaces documented in the user manual, including the ADC/DAC ports, QSFP28 ports, FMC+ interface, DDR4 memory, and user I/O.
